## Professional Certificate - 7 course series

Gain the job-ready skills for an entry-level mainframe programming role. Mainframe computers continue to power many mission-critical, financial, banking, and government agency systems. There are 220 billion lines of COBOL in use today. 43% of banking systems are built on COBOL, and 95% percent of ATM swipes rely on COBOL code.¹  

COBOL is scalable, mature, and self-documenting. You'll learn about COBOL from its birth and through its evolution. You'll learn new features and aspects of the language, while also getting hands-on experience to increase your knowledge and abilities with COBOL as a whole. You’ll work with a variety of IBM, COBOL, and mainframe assets, project scenarios, including COBOL programming basics, TSO, ISPF, gaining practical experience with mainframe data management and software development techniques. 

This Professional Certificate does not require any prior programming skills and is suitable for learners without college degrees. 

Upon successful completion of this program, you’ll have analyzed the real-world mainframe environment, reviewed mainframe assets and data, and presented and created a software development plan, giving you the confidence and the portfolio to begin a career as a mainframe programmer.

### Applied Learning Project

Power your programming career by learning the core principles of mainframe programming and software development through hands-on skills practice. Learners will build and complete COBOL code and projects utilizing an IBM z/OS mainframe lab environment, with instructions and videos to help guide them. Upon completion, learners will have accessed, reviewed, and interacted with an actual IBM mainframe computer, created sample data sets and lines of COBOL code. Learners will create a detailed software development plan and supporting systems analysis documentation.
